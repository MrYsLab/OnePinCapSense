Manifest:
   This package contains:
     1. The library files OnePinCapSense.h and OnePinCapSense.cpp
     2. An example program, called OnePinCapSenseExample.ino , 
        demonstrating 5 capacitive sensors and 5 associated LED
        indicators.
     3. A diagram showing a typical hardware implementation for a 
        single sensor and LED. Duplicate this for as many sensors
        as you require.
     4. A sample Scratch 2.0 test program called testCapSense.sb2
     5. This README.txt file
     
To install, follow the library installation instructions on:
     http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries
     

This library was based upon the following references and previous projects:

Rationale for this library:

I wanted to have an inexpensive and simple way to detect user touch of an object,
with the requirements of utilizing one pin per sensor, no use grounding, and allowing for 
multi-touch capabilities.  

The instructables project listed above did just that, 
but was written specifically for the Arduino UNO pinmap.
I have modified that work to allow for use with the Leonardo as well, by using 
standard Macros provided as part of the Arduino software IDE. Although only tested
with the UNO and Leonardo, it should work with all other Arduino boards.

The example program sends out key strokes using the Keyboard facility of the Leonardo.
This feature can be turned off by commenting out a #ifded in the example.
